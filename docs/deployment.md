# Deployment

Language: English | [简体中文](zh-CN/deployment.md) | [日本語](ja/deployment.md)

TokenHub is designed for private deployment with a Go backend, a Next.js admin console, and support for SQLite or PostgreSQL persistence.

## Database Selection

TokenHub supports two database backends:

### SQLite (Default)

**Advantages:**
- Zero configuration, no separate database service required
- Suitable for small to medium deployments
- Simple backups (direct file copy)

**Use cases:**
- Development and testing environments
- Deployments with fewer than 1000 users
- Single-server deployments

**Deployment:**

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### PostgreSQL (Production Recommended)

**Advantages:**
- Enterprise-grade database for high concurrency scenarios
- Better transaction support and data integrity
- Supports replication and high availability

**Use cases:**
- Production environments
- Deployments with more than 1000 users
- High-availability requirements

**Deployment:**

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d
```

For detailed PostgreSQL configuration, see the [PostgreSQL Setup Guide](postgresql-setup.md).

### Multi-instance deployment with remote PostgreSQL

Use `deploy/docker-compose.remote-postgres.yml` when PostgreSQL is managed outside this Compose project. It adds an Nginx gateway in front of scalable backend and frontend services and does not start a local database.

Set the remote `TOKENHUB_DATABASE_URL`, public gateway URL, production secrets, and trusted proxy CIDR, then run:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env \
  -f deploy/docker-compose.remote-postgres.yml up -d \
  --scale tokenhub-backend=3 \
  --scale tokenhub-frontend=2
```

All replicas must use the same `TOKENHUB_SECRET_KEY`. Size `TOKENHUB_DB_MAX_OPEN_CONNS` per replica so the combined pool remains below the PostgreSQL connection limit. Never share a SQLite file between backend replicas.

Run the real two-instance PostgreSQL E2E suite with `./deploy/test-multi-instance.sh`.

## Docker Compose

Create a deployment environment file:

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env
```

Edit `deploy/.env` before starting:

- `TOKENHUB_ADMIN_TOKEN`: Admin API bootstrap token. Use a random value of at least 32 bytes.
- `TOKENHUB_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Password used only when creating the initial `admin` user. Use at least 12 bytes.
- `TOKENHUB_SECRET_KEY`: Backend secret key. Use a random value of at least 32 bytes and keep it stable.
- `TOKENHUB_IMAGE_TAG`: Shared backend and frontend image tag. Default: `latest`.
- `TOKENHUB_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: Public backend URL shown to users.
- `TOKENHUB_API_BASE_URL`: Backend URL used by the browser admin console. The frontend server reads it at runtime. The deprecated `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` remains a fallback for one compatibility cycle.
- `TOKENHUB_BACKEND_PORT`: Host port for the backend. Default: `8080`.
- `TOKENHUB_FRONTEND_PORT`: Host port for the admin console. Default: `3000`.

Start the stack from the repository root:

```bash
./deploy/install.sh
```

The script validates the Compose environment, pulls the published images, and starts the containers without building locally. If the images cannot be pulled during the initial GHCR rollout, it falls back to building from the local checkout. Validation errors name every unsafe variable without printing their values. If Compose fails and a backend container created or restarted by that attempt is exited, restarting, dead, or unhealthy, the script prints up to 100 backend log lines from that attempt. Failures outside the backend do not export unrelated backend logs.

Validate without pulling or starting containers:

```bash
./deploy/install.sh --check-only
```

Use a different environment file with `./deploy/install.sh --env-file /path/to/deploy.env`.

### Published image lifecycle

GitHub Actions publishes `ghcr.io/astaxie/tokenhub-backend` and `ghcr.io/astaxie/tokenhub-frontend` for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

- Publishing a GitHub Release builds the exact semantic-version tag. A non-prerelease also updates the major-minor tag and `latest`.
- `workflow_dispatch` can publish `edge` or an isolated `manual-*` tag. It cannot overwrite release or `latest` tags.
- Pull requests do not build or push container images.
- Merges to `main` do not publish images.

Each image is first pushed under a run-specific staging tag. The workflow verifies that both multi-platform images exist before promoting either one to the requested release tags. Both images must use the same `TOKENHUB_IMAGE_TAG`. For reproducible production deployments, pin an exact release tag instead of relying on `latest`.

The first GHCR publication creates private packages. The repository owner must make both packages public before anonymous deployments can pull them. Until then, a deployment using the default `latest` tag remains usable by automatically falling back to a local source build. If an explicit `TOKENHUB_IMAGE_TAG` cannot be pulled, the installer exits instead of labeling current source as that version.

### Optional local build

Build from the current checkout instead of pulling published images:

```bash
./deploy/install.sh --build
```

The following acceleration settings apply only to local source builds.

The project Dockerfiles do not hard-code regional package mirrors. If your server has slow access to Docker Hub, npm, or Go module sources, configure acceleration on the deployment host instead of editing Dockerfiles.

For Docker base image pulls, configure Docker daemon registry mirrors on the server, for example in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`, then restart Docker:

```json
{
	"registry-mirrors": [
		"https://<your-docker-registry-mirror>"
	]
}
```

For dependency downloads during image builds, prefer configuring an outbound HTTP/HTTPS proxy for Docker or BuildKit on the server. This keeps builds portable and avoids committing environment-specific npm or Go proxy settings to the repository.

If you deploy in an environment where direct access to upstream registries is slow, the following server-side examples can be used as references:

```bash
# Go module downloads
go env -w GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct

# npm package downloads
npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com
```

These commands configure the server or build environment. Do not add them directly to project Dockerfiles unless you intentionally maintain an environment-specific fork.

The compose file starts:

- Backend on `http://localhost:8080`
- Frontend on `http://localhost:3000`
- SQLite data stored in the named Docker volume `tokenhub-data`
- Model catalog included in the selected backend image

Check status:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.yml ps
```

Initial admin login:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: the configured `TOKENHUB_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`

For `prod`, `production`, staging, and other non-development environments, startup rejects placeholder values, admin tokens or secret keys shorter than 32 bytes, and bootstrap passwords shorter than 12 bytes.

View or follow logs manually:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.yml logs -f
```

Stop:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.yml down
```

Stop and remove the SQLite data volume:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

Only use `down -v` when you intentionally want to delete local data.

| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | empty | Deprecated compatibility fallback; migrate to `TOKENHUB_API_BASE_URL` |

## Data and Backups

SQLite is the persistent source for projects, keys, Providers, routes, users, request logs, usage, alerts, approvals, sessions, and backup records.

In the one-command compose deployment:

- Database path inside the backend container: `/app/data/tokenhub.db`
- Backup path inside the backend container: `/app/data/backups`
- Docker volume name: `tokenhub-data`

Recommended production setup:

- Store the SQLite database on a persistent disk.
- Store backups outside the application container.
- Rotate old backups according to your retention policy.
- Keep provider credentials and admin tokens in a secret manager or protected environment variables.

## Model Catalog

Published backend images include the matching `data/model-catalog.yaml` at `/app/catalog/model-catalog.yaml`. Default deployments use this copy so the backend binary and catalog always come from the same image version.

To mount a custom catalog explicitly:

```bash
./deploy/install.sh --model-catalog /absolute/path/to/model-catalog.yaml
```

The custom mount intentionally overrides the image catalog and is therefore managed separately from `TOKENHUB_IMAGE_TAG`. After updating that file, restart the backend container and confirm the entries in `Model Catalog`.

## Reverse Proxy

For production, place TokenHub behind HTTPS and forward:

- Admin console traffic to the frontend service.
- `/v1/*` and `/api/admin/*` traffic to the backend service.

Set request body and streaming timeouts high enough for long model responses.

Use `/livez` for liveness and `/readyz` for readiness. `/readyz` and the backwards-compatible `/healthz` return `503` when the database is unavailable.
